# hello-world
Initial repo testing

Hi all!

Thanks for coming to my GitHub page to learn more about my coding journey. As a classically trained statistician, I am always growing and learning in best practices and development. If you have any fun ideas you want to collaborate on, I am happy to give it a shot. While my background is heavily biased towards leveraging R/RStudio, I am currently focused on expanding my skillset in Python and ArcGIS.

Cheers!
B
